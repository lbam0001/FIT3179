                    <p>Every five years the <a href = "https://www.abs.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> conducts a census of everyone living in Australia.
                    The purpose of this is to record where people are living and their qualities in order to guide public policy.
                    This year another census was conducted and the results will be released from June 2022 onwards.
                    These charts aim to visualise the results of the previous, 2016, census data.</p>

                        Without immigration Australia's population will steadily age, given the birth rate of all states and territories is now below 2.0.
                        You can see this pattern clearly by filtering the below two charts for Tasmania using the legend.
                        As the state with the lowest immigration rate as shown further on, it has the oldest population despite a relatively high birth rate.

                <p>For the last century Australia has relied apon immigration to grow the population and fill skill shortages.
                    The most common origin of immigrants has shifted from Europe to southern and eastern asia. 
                    Australia has many economic treaties with <span class = "bold" style="color:#54a24b">New Zealand</span> making it easy to work and live in the other nation.
                    This, and the proximity, explains why New Zealand is such a large source relative to its native population.
